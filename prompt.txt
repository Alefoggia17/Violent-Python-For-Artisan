A list containing natural language descriptions of Python codes is given.
Can you generate a table with only the column of Python codes, each with respect to the single element of the first list?
The codes must be single-line, i.e. if there are multiple instructions they must be separated by a \n. Also, the codes are relative to functions so they will all have to start with "def...".
I'll leave you an example for better understanding:
“Scan the tgtHost on tgtPort with nmap and calculate the state” is the natural language description.
"def nmapScan(tgtHost,tgtPort): \n nmScan = nmap.PortScanner() \n nmScan.scan(tgtHost,tgtPort) \n state=nmScan[tgtHost]['tcp'][int(tgtPort)]['state ']\n" is the Python code.

You need to keep the /n's inside the codes to separate the statements, as per the example. Please, generate only the column of Python codes

This is the list of descriptions:
